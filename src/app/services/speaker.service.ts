The NDP4 prioritized specific economic sectors that are perceived to have more potential to grow the economy and provide employment opportunities. This is notably agriculture, logistics, tourism, and manufacturing. The Plan also propounds a hands-on approach with regard to the Government’s role in economic development albeit in closer and effective collaboration with the private sector. Over the course of the NDP4 period the Namibian economy grew on average at 5.7 percent, despite the global economic crises and current global commodity crises.

The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) is the State’s lead agency in attracting private investment in resources exploration and development through the provision of geoscientific information on minerals and energy resources, and management of an equitable and secure titles systems for the mining, petroleum and geothermal industries. As the Minister of Mines and Energy, he seeks to provides access to Namibia's geological, mineral and energy resources for sustainable economic growth, equal benefit and prosperity to all Namibian citizens.
